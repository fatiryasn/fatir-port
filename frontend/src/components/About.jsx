      <h1 className="font-bold font-poppins text-2xl">Unknown</h1>
      <p className="font-quicksand mt-2">My curiosity was begin when i searching out how to make a game at 12 years old. When i found out, programming is the answer and i wanted to try it. But i realize i don't have a laptop back then. So im just a player not a creator.</p>
      <h1 className="font-bold font-poppins text-2xl mt-5">Begin</h1>
      <p className="font-quicksand mt-2">After 2 years long, i finally got my first ever laptop then i started learning Web Development, because my laptop can't handle if i go to Game Development. I searched all the roadmap then i started from HTML. It was real struggle at the first time. After 1 month, i went for CSS to improve the style of the web.</p>
      <h1 className="font-bold font-poppins text-2xl mt-5">JS Clash</h1>
      <p className="font-quicksand mt-2">3 months has passed, the next roadmap is JavaScript. I thought that JavaScript is gonna be easy but i totally wrong, it was hard for me because i didn't have any basic programming sense. I spent like 5 months only in JavaScript from "Hello World!" to asynchrounous JS (i was lazy).</p>
      <h1 className="font-bold font-poppins text-2xl mt-5">Backend</h1>
      <p className="font-quicksand mt-2">I chose backend first because in my opinion, designing is eazy you just need creativity. So, i started backend with Node.js and Express.js with MongoDB as Database. I took 2 months to learn on it.</p>
      <h1 className="font-bold font-poppins text-2xl mt-5">Fullstack Project</h1>
      <p className="font-quicksand mt-2">My first ever project, Contactsaver is a very simple and basic project powered with MERN Stack, in fact i learn React.js along with building this project, it takes 4 days of making. You can see now at Projects section!.</p>
